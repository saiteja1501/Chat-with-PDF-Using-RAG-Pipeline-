The provided Python code is a **Streamlit application** that lets users upload PDF and Word files, process their content into a searchable knowledge base, and then chat with an AI to ask questions about the uploaded files. Here’s a step-by-step explanation in simple terms:

---

### **1. Application Setup**
- The app uses **Streamlit**, a Python framework for building interactive web apps.
- The app’s main features are:
  - File upload (PDF or DOCX).
  - Processing the files into searchable chunks of text.
  - Enabling a chatbot interface to interact with the content.

---

### **2. Components in the App**

#### **a. User Interface**
- **Sidebar**: 
  - Allows users to upload files (`.pdf` or `.docx`) via the `st.file_uploader` method.
  - Accepts multiple files and stores them for processing.
  - Users must also input their OpenAI API key to enable chat functionalities.
  - A "Process" button triggers file processing.
  
- **Main Area**:
  - Displays the chatbot interface where users can input questions.

---

#### **b. Backend Logic**
1. **File Processing**:
   - The app processes the uploaded files and extracts their text.
     - **PDF Files**: Text is extracted using `PyPDF2`.
     - **Word Files**: Text is extracted using `python-docx`.

2. **Splitting Text into Chunks**:
   - The app divides the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks using the `CharacterTextSplitter` class from LangChain.
   - **Why?**: Smaller chunks are easier to process and search through.

3. **Creating a Vector Store**:
   - A vector store is a database where the text chunks are stored as embeddings (numerical representations of text).
   - **Embedding Generation**:
     - The app uses **HuggingFaceEmbeddings** to convert text into embeddings.
   - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
     - FAISS stores these embeddings and enables fast similarity searches.

4. **Setting Up the Chatbot**:
   - A **Conversational Retrieval Chain** (from LangChain) is created. This combines:
     - An **LLM (Language Model)**: 
       - OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 is used for answering questions.
     - **Retriever**: Retrieves relevant text chunks from the vector store.
     - **Memory**: Keeps track of previous conversations for continuity.

---

### **3. Chat Functionality**
- Once the files are processed, users can ask questions via a chat input box.
- The app:
  1. Passes the question to the conversation chain.
  2. Retrieves relevant information from the processed text.
  3. Displays the response in the chat interface, along with the cost of using OpenAI’s API (tokens used).

---

### **4. Helper Functions**
- `get_files_text`: Reads the text from uploaded files.
- `get_pdf_text` / `get_docx_text`: Extracts text from PDF and Word files.
- `get_text_chunks`: Splits the combined text into chunks.
- `get_vectorstore`: Creates a vector store for storing and searching through embeddings.
- `get_conversation_chain`: Sets up the AI chat system with memory and retrieval capabilities.
- `handel_userinput`: Manages user queries, retrieves responses, and displays the chat history.

---

### **5. Running the App**
The app starts with `main()`:
- Users upload files, input their API key, and process the files.
- Once processing is complete, the chatbot is ready to answer questions based on the file content.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-file Support**: Handles multiple PDFs and Word files.
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 to answer questions.
- **Context Awareness**: Keeps track of conversation history for natural interactions.
- **Cost Tracking**: Shows the cost of each chat interaction in terms of OpenAI token usage.
